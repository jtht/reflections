When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my work with others. Also if I want to backup my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So that I wouldnâ€™t have a half-finished product on Git
