What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

a new directory, .git, is created in the cwd but nothing is committed. It’s needed
because the files in .git track the versions of your files so it needs to be
created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

There aren’t any actual files stored in the staging area. It offers the benefit of 
separating your commits so you can group them logically and have appropriate commit
messages.
